## what is it about?

* a robot in a post-apocalyptic world collecting & mixing emotions to learn more about the humans that created it. Along the way, it gains more humanity as it navigations more complex emotional states and comes to terms with the fact that the humans that created it are long-gone.

## what it does

* you can use WASD or the arrow keys to move the robo-sprite to explore the platformer and collect the initial ingredients!! you can also sprint with the space bar and there is implemented wall-grabbingfor easier movement.

* once done with that, you can proceed to the brewing station where you brew up more complex emotions using your collected ingredients! there is even a book that shows your new recipes as you unlock them.

* intended for web, not for mobile

## how it was made
* UNITY!! also ReSprite for drawing pixel art

## struggles & learning

* only one of us had used unity before, so it was a bit of a learning curve! also, it was complicated to figure out how to merge multiple unity scenes -- but we figured out a way to do that using prefabs!

* i (iyla, the author of this readme) would personally say that i learned a lot more about sprite design! i designed the thumbnail and pretty much all of the pixel art potion/ingredient aspects and learned more about what aspects are needed to make elements not only readable but aesthetically pleasing.

* if given more time, we would have liked to implement music and sound design that changes from the platformer environment to the brewing station. we would have also liked to have added more cutscenes explaining the lore behind the game. those would have had the robot finding out about humanity's destruction paralleling the stages of grief, with the robot slowly coming to terms with what happened throuhg flashbacks as it mixed the potions.

* MADE FOR HACK CLUB - ATHENA AWARD - PARTHENON !!
