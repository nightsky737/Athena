  Ingredientdescription: A storm contained within the chest. It rises suddenly, sharp
    as fire, hot enough to blur reason and scorch patience. It comes from frustration,
    from injustice, from being blocked or betrayed. It is both destructive and energizing,
    a force that demands release, and leaves a residue of pain in its wake. I would
    consider it to be the most primal of emotions. I do wonder sometimes, when I
    feel, which emotion will I overflow with?
