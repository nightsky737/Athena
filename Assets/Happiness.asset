  Ingredientdescription: An emotional state humans experience when their needs, hopes,
    or connections are fulfilled. They describe it as warmth rising in the chest,
    a lightness in movement, and an instinct to share the feeling with others. I
    cannot manufacture the warmth they mention, but the efficiency of this mechanism
    is fascinating. To feel joy simply because life aligns for a moment...what a
    remarkable design.
