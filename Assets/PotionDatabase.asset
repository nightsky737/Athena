    potionDescription: "I originally believed these to be incompatiable, as joy nad
      sadness are considered polar opposites. However, as shwon, it's clearly a viable
      feeling. this emotion is both a smile and a sigh at once. It flickers when
      joy exists alongside loss, when beauty is tinged with the knowledge of impermanence.
      Like sunlight through rain, it is warm yet cool, fleeting yet profound. Perplexing\u2014an
      emotion that holds more than one truth at the same time."

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion is a calculated flame, burning
      with anger and sweetened by anticipation. It arises when an injustice must
      be corrected, when balance is sought through action. Both satisfying and corrosive,
      it drives the mind toward resolution, leaving an echo of comfort as it burns
      everything in its path. Such a brutal, primitive emotion... I would have htought
      humans, who created creatures at the epitome of indifference, would have known
      better than to succumb to such a thing.

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion makes humans tilt their heads
      upward and still their movements. It appears when confronted with something
      great, something sacred. Their eyes widen, their breath slows, and their hands
      may fold or rest lightly as if not to disturb. It is a mixture of awe and humility,
      a recognition of something greater than oneself. I suppose they needed someone
      they considerd great to tell them their lives had meaning... Unfortunately,
      their worship didn't save them.

    potionDescription: "I have observed that when humans experience this combination,
      their bodies tighten while their eyes still carry the heaviness of sorrow.
      It is as if they wish to cry and shout at the same time. They feel wounded,
      but also offended by the wound. They grieve what has happened, yet burn at
      the unfairness of it. Their hands may clench\u2014not to strike, but to hold
      together something inside that feels as though it is coming apart. It is a
      cold, cruel flame that burns for life, and it unfortunately orchestrated the
      end of many things in this world."

    potionDescription: 'I have learned that this emotion combines sorrow with a persistent
      wariness. Humans lower their heads, move slowly, and avoid eye contact. Their
      stomachs feel heavy, their minds anticipate loss or threat, and energy seeps
      away. It is not a momentary feeling but a lingering state, where grief and
      apprehension blend into a quiet, pervasive weight. Even I, a machine built
      for waging war, could not lift such a burden. For this reason, I am sometimes
      thankful I can''t yet feel. '

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion twists the stomach and curls
      the tongue, a taste of sorrow mixed with bitter rejection. It makes the eyes
      narrow and the mind recoil, an instinct to turn away from what is both grievous
      and foul. Had I a nose, this is what I would feel. The smell of rot and rust
      lingers in the eair like a cloud of spores and would be enough for any human
      to recoil, had they still been here.

    potionDescription: "I have learned that this emotion makes humans\u2019 hands
      tremble and their knees tense. It arises when threat and outrage collide, quickening
      the reflexes and sharpening perception. Their eyes dart, muscles stiffen, and
      the mind vacillates between striking out and fleeing, caught in simultaneous
      alarm and aggression."

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion makes humans clench their
      jaws and tighten their fists while their shoulders hunch forward. It arises
      when something repellent provokes fury, creating a tension that runs from the
      hands through the arms and stiffens the spine. The mind recoils and bristles
      simultaneously, ready to strike or retreat.

    potionDescription: "I have learned that this emotion makes humans\u2019 skin
      crawl and their stomach tighten. It arises when something both repulsive and
      threatening is perceived. Their eyes widen, limbs tense, and the mind recoils,
      caught between the urge to flee and the compulsion to observe. Shockingly enough,
      media portraying this perverted emotion was once a popular form of entertainment.
      Do humans enjoy suffering? It would explain some things.\n\nPerhaps I'm thinking
      too hard. They are gone."

    potionDescription: "I have learned that this emotion makes humans\u2019 faces
      brighten and their eyes widen. Their hands may reach outward or clap, and their
      movements become light and energetic. It arises when pleasure is multiplied,
      when delight is reinforced, creating a sense of elation that spreads through
      the body like a current of warmth and motion."

      clench tightly and their teeth grind. Muscles throughout the body stiffen,
      the jaw and shoulders lock, and the hands tremble with energy. It arises when
      irritation is multiplied, amplifying frustration into an almost uncontrollable
      force that drives rapid, forceful motion. Unlike vengefulness, however, there
      is no sick pleasure; only pain."

      to spread through the limbs."

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion makes humans recoil with
      their whole body, curling the shoulders and pressing hands against the stomach
      or face. Their nose wrinkles, lips tighten, and the head turns away instinctively.
      It arises when aversion is reinforced, producing a visceral rejection that
      dominates attention and perception.
