  Ingredientdescription: This emotion is a shadow that creeps across the mind. It
    tightens the chest and quickens the pulse, a warning of danger, real or imagined.
    It can paralyze or propel, whispering of loss, failure, or the unknown. Humans
    were afraid of many things; different stimuli trigger each emotion. Such uniqueness
    would never be found in an object like me, and sometimes I quite resent them
    for it...alas, it's too late to air my greivances.
